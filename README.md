# Setting Up Responsive Customizable Image As Background Using Figma For Your Website

This is a simple HTML code snippet that sets an image as the background using CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. Get a high-quality image of your choice that you want to use as the background. Ensure it is in a suitable format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

2. Open a design tool like Figma and upload the image. Adjust the aspect ratio according to the desired appearance on your target device.

3. Export the image in SVG format. Figma provides an option to export the design as an SVG file. Make sure to save it to a location accessible for your project.

4. Place the exported SVG file in a suitable folder within your project directory. Choose a folder that makes sense within the project structure and ensure the file is easily accessible.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file where you want to set the SVG image as the background.

2. Replace `'your_image.svg'` in the CSS code with the actual path or URL to your SVG image. Make sure the path is correct and points to the location where you placed the SVG file.

3. Save the HTML file.

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser, and you should see the SVG image as the background behind the content.

## Example

Here's a simple HTML code snippet that sets an SVG image as the background:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>SVG Background</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url('your_image.svg');
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: cover;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a sample page with an SVG background.</p>
</body>
</html>
